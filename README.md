HSRproblem
==========

HSR(n,k,q): you are given k jars and allowed try q times to find the maximal rungs.

1:  The HSRkqStruct method can calculate the maxmimal rungs given k jars and allowed to try q times
and The data2edgeList can generate a list of edge of decision tree then the drawGraph method can draw a graph
of this tree to demenstrate it

2: the hsrNK method can calculate the minimal tries needed to judge N rungs given n rungs
